# Vue.js-with-Firebase

A Simple Vue.js project with Vue-Resource from firebase database 

Note: In this project I have used Vue-resource API for AJAX and FIREBASE and Vue-Resource is now removed from Vue 2.0
But many of the devs still use Vue-Resource for Ajax and database purposes

If vue-cli is not installed then first install it from (http://vuejs.org/)

## Things to run on local server
```
npm install

npm run dev
```

## Firebase account is optional , json file can be only readable only.
